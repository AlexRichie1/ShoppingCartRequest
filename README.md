# ShoppingCartRequest
This tool will allow in a simple way to get the information from a website, checking for a shopping cart, in the webpages that allows this search

The main idea is to develop the ways a website can have different request to get this information and add it to the code.
So far, the base has its own structure to get it from HTML which will allow only simple webpages and the ones with no blocks on it, to get the info.
